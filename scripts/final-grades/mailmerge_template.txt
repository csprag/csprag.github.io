SUBJECT: [c4cs] Final Grades
FROM: c4cs-staff@umich.edu

Hello {{name}},

Your final course grade is {{number}}/100.00, {{letter}}.
{% if number|float >= 80 %}
It was wonderful having everyone in class this term. We hope that this course will help you throughout the rest of your career in computer science, or whatever career path you may pursue.
{% endif %}
Materials from class will remain online on the course homepage and free for anyone to access in perpetuity.

One of the challenges we continually face is reaching out to incoming computer science students. Many reviews "wish they had taken this before 280/281", but it is hard for us to reach students who have not yet declared CS (and joined our e-mail lists) or found the CSE Facebook group. If you found this course helpful, please help our outreach efforts by encouraging new students in CS to consider c4cs.

If there are ways in which you think we could improve the class, please let us know in the anonymous feedback form below.

If you have any questions about how final grades were calculated, please refer to the grading section on our course website and script used to generate final grades from Canvas.
