### Useful Options / Examples

  * Use `clear` anytime you want to clear the screen, like when you want to hide old output before running a new program.
  * You can use CTRL+L to acheive the same effect.
  * The screen is cleared, but if your terminal allows scrolling, you can scroll up to see past commands.
  * Use COMMAND+K or `reset` to clear the scrollback buffer as well.
  * From a shell, like the Python interactive shell, the keyboard shortcuts work when the commands don't.
